Feel free to wield and modify the code as thou see fit, but remember, with great power cometh great responsibility.

<h3> Spottheth Bugs? üêõ </h3>
Should thou wish to join our noble fellowship, or if thou hast encountered a buggeth, do not hesitate to send forth a raven with a <a href="https://youtu.be/73pWy7cLnMg?si=dKtqGOBuTZGo0T84&t=27"target="_blank">message</a>

We endeavored to fortify the code, yet there may linger a few elusive bugs in its midst. Contributors, uphold the principles of clean code, and deploy the powers of testing to vanquish any lurking bugs. This for the elusive quest for buggeth-free code
A thousand thanks.
